jQuery Twister

NOTE: THIS PLUGIN ONLY WORKS IN BROWSERS THAT DON'T SUCK. That means you'll have to do something else for IE. Apparently Firefox (Windows) doesn't play nice either, but I'm working on that.

Summary
=======

jQuery Twister is a simple plugin that adds a "twist" effect to images when you hover over them. It is dependent on zachstronaut's jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale (http://github.com/zachstronaut/jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale/) for animating element rotation in modern browsers, and I take no credit for his work (which does most of the heavy lifting).

Usage
=====

Unpack the JS files from the root and lib/ directories into your document root and include the following lines before the </head> tag at the top of your document (change the src paths if you put them in another directory):

<script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jquery.transform.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jquery.rotate.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jquery.twister.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Initialize twister with the following:

<script>$(function(){ $(selector).twister(); });</script>

Options
=======

duration (String, Number): a string representing one of the predefined speeds ("slow" or "fast") or the number of milliseconds to run the animation (default: 250).

degrees (Number): a number representing degrees the image will rotate (default: 5)

scale (Number): a number representing how much to scale the image (default: 1.2)

overflown (Boolean): if set to true, the image will not be masked by it's containing frame. (default: false)

Limitations and Dependencies
============================

This plugin is dependent on zachstronaut's jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale (http://github.com/zachstronaut/jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale/) and is therefore limited to jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale's abilities. It does not, unfortunately, play nicely with Internet Explorer at this time. I am actively looking for a replacement that uses canvas for image rotation, but until I find or write one, there is no way around this limitation (IE just doesn't have a good CSS based rotate method). There are also (apparently) issues in Firefox for Windows that I will fix soon.

I know for a fact that it works in Safari (Win / Mac), Firefox (Mac), Chrome (Mac). Still need to do some Windows testing.

I also haven't tested in Opera yet. If it doesn't work in Opera, give me a heads-up.
